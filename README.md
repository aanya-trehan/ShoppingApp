## Overview
My project is focused on leveraging APIs to enhance user experience and streamline product browsing within a Kotlin application. By integrating Retrofit and Gson libraries, I am trying to develop a robust solution to fetch and display product data from external sources seamlessly.

## Steps Followed 
### Step 1: Adding Dependencies
I started the project by including essential dependencies in the build.gradle file - Retrofit and Gson were integrated to simplify API communication and JSON parsing processes

### Step 2: Converting JSON Data
To handle data from APIs efficiently, an  extension was used to convert JSON responses into Kotlin classes. This step was done for  compatibility and easier use when working with the API data.

### Step 3: Creating Interface
A simple interface was then created to facilitate smooth communication between the application and external data.

### Step 4: Fetching API Data
Retrofit is utilised to make HTTP requests and retrieve product information dynamically.

## Future Plans
All steps above have been completed and a simple user interface has been established. I plan to add more features as well as a more modern UI design.

## Technologies Used
Kotlin
Retrofit
Gson
